593,Data Scientist - Ads Sales (Remote),Quora,British Columbia,Vancouver,8062.5,10687.5,CAD,"[As of June 2020, Quora has become a ""remote-first"" company. This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]

About Quora:

The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

About the Team:

Unsurprisingly, then, the Data Team is highly empowered at Quora, helping navigate complexity and influencing product and company strategy directly. Quora's outsized commitment to data is visible in everything we do, from our rigor-driven experimentation processes to the backgrounds of our leaders (including many Product Managers and the Head of Product being former full-time data scientists). With this emphasis on data and empirics, we aim to balance rigor and pragmatism, searching for scrappy solutions in pursuit of our mission. In joining Quora's strong data team, you'll both benefit from and work to advance our culture of rational decision making.

About the Role:

As a data scientist in ads, you'll work closely with sales leadership, product managers, and engineers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, build visualizations, design randomized controlled experiments, and tackle hard, open-ended problems that uncover usage patterns and opportunities for the company. In this role, you will deliver data-driven insights to guide our business strategy and extract untapped value in our platform by developing a deep understanding of our advertisers and users. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. For more about our work, see Quora's Data blog at https://quoradata.quora.com/.

Responsibilities:
Extract actionable insights from broad, open-ended questions to influence sales and product strategy and drive roadmap decisions
Analyze data to understand the root causes of metric movements and uncover growth opportunities
Design and evaluate A/B tests to make informed recommendations on product changes
Develop metrics and create dashboards to orient the direction of business development and track the success of the business
Communicate insights and recommendations to key partners
Improve the work of other data scientists through mentorship, tool development, and by bringing good industry practices to the team
Minimum Qualifications:
Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time). Learn why here
B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in a quantitative field
2+ years work experience in sales analytics, product analytics, or data science at a consumer tech company (e.g. open-ended analyses, metric development, A/B testing)
Proficiency in using SQL and procedural programming languages (e.g. Python, R) to manipulate and analyze data
Familiarity with theoretical foundations of statistical techniques (e.g. hypothesis testing, regression)
Demonstrated ability to exercise judgment and combine quantitative skills with intuition to translate numbers into insights
Demonstrated ability to clearly explain data results to cross-functional teams
Preferred Qualifications:
4+ years work experience in sales analytics, product analytics, or data science at a consumer tech company (e.g. open-ended analyses, metric development, A/B testing)
Experience evangelizing best practices and process improvements on your team
Experience working with large data sets and distributed computing tools (e.g. Presto, Redshift)
Experience pushing code and navigating a complex codebase

614,Senior Full Stack Engineer (Toronto or Vancouver Hub - Remote),Barley,British Columbia,Vancouver,8125.0,10937.5,CAD,"About Barley

Compensation accounts for up to 70% of an organization’s total operating costs, yet the processes and tools used to determine who gets paid what, why, and how is still painfully convoluted and manual. How is this possible? Believe it or not, most companies are still using a dizzying amount of spreadsheets that ultimately leaves leadership guessing and the employees puzzled or worse yet, unfairly compensated.

620,Intermediate Software Engineer,Bench Accounting,British Columbia,Vancouver,6787.5,,CAD,"What's Bench? Check us out in Medium, Betakit, Financial Post, our Instagram, and our Life at Bench Blog.

We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.

Businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between managing their books and running their businesses.

Our mission is to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people. From creatives to chiropractors, Bench helps thousands of small business owners and entrepreneurs master their financial lives. Because understanding your finances should be three things: simple, effortless, and affordable.

We're growing fast, and we're looking for exceptional people to join us on this incredible journey. Check out our culture guide to learn more about what it's like to work at Bench and read more about our business here!

Dear future Benchmate,

There has never been a more exciting time to join Bench. We're on our way to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people.

Finance is inseparable from the human experience. Our personal finances influence our mental and physical wellbeing, where we live, our education, our family structures, and the opportunities we do or do not have. In the mind of a small business owner, there is no distinction between their business finances and their personal finances. Working at a Bench isn't about fintech; it's about making a difference in the quality of life of human beings.

Bench is already the biggest bookkeeper in North America—we currently have over 11,000 clients, and in 2020 alone we processed $21B in transactions—and we're just at the beginning of our technological journey.

We need help improving the internal tools for our developers to have the best experience. Our mission is improving our technology and processes to enhance the speed and quality of our engineering, with a strong focus on the reduction of technical debt. We're looking for intermediate software engineers who align with our mission of using technology to improve the lives of our Benchmates so they can build the tools to help our customers succeed. What we do is immensely creative; it requires us to fall in love with the problems we're tackling, and then challenge ourselves to resolve them with the simplest solutions we can dream up.

Here is an insight into this Intermediate Software Engineer position at Bench:

Do you enjoy debugging complex problems in code you did not write?
Are you comfortable with being on-call once per month for issues that are impacting our clients or Benchmates (we pay extra for this too)?
Do you seek efficiency through automation and tooling?
Does a slow or inefficient CI/CD pipeline frustrate you?
Does finding creative ways to configure and setup efficient and effective local development environments bring you joy?
Are you interested in dabbling in machine learning systems?
Are you someone who enjoys the speed, simplicity, and ease of working in a well architected AWS infrastructure?
Are you the type of person who is frustrated or inspired by technical debt that you want to pay it down and find ways to avoid it building up again?
Does finding or resolving security vulnerabilities in code, systems and services bring you joy and satisfaction?

If this aligns with your passion and career goals, then I look forward to meeting you and discussing how you can grow with us.

Sincerely,

Check us out in Medium, Betakit, Financial Post, our Instagram, and our Life at Bench Blog.

We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.

Businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between managing their books and running their businesses.

Our mission is to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people. From creatives to chiropractors, Bench helps thousands of small business owners and entrepreneurs master their financial lives. Because understanding your finances should be three things: simple, effortless, and affordable.

We're growing fast, and we're looking for exceptional people to join us on this incredible journey. Check out our culture guide to learn more about what it's like to work at Bench and read more about our business here!

Dear future Benchmate,

There has never been a more exciting time to join Bench. We're on our way to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people.

Finance is inseparable from the human experience. Our personal finances influence our mental and physical wellbeing, where we live, our education, our family structures, and the opportunities we do or do not have. In the mind of a small business owner, there is no distinction between their business finances and their personal finances. Working at a Bench isn't about fintech; it's about making a difference in the quality of life of human beings.

Bench is already the biggest bookkeeper in North America—we currently have over 11,000 clients, and in 2020 alone we processed $21B in transactions—and we're just at the beginning of our technological journey.

We need help improving the internal tools for our developers to have the best experience. Our mission is improving our technology and processes to enhance the speed and quality of our engineering, with a strong focus on the reduction of technical debt. We're looking for intermediate software engineers who align with our mission of using technology to improve the lives of our Benchmates so they can build the tools to help our customers succeed. What we do is immensely creative; it requires us to fall in love with the problems we're tackling, and then challenge ourselves to resolve them with the simplest solutions we can dream up.

Here is an insight into this Intermediate Software Engineer position at Bench:

Do you enjoy debugging complex problems in code you did not write?
Are you comfortable with being on-call once per month for issues that are impacting our clients or Benchmates (we pay extra for this too)?
Do you seek efficiency through automation and tooling?
Does a slow or inefficient CI/CD pipeline frustrate you?
Does finding creative ways to configure and setup efficient and effective local development environments bring you joy?
Are you interested in dabbling in machine learning systems?
Are you someone who enjoys the speed, simplicity, and ease of working in a well architected AWS infrastructure?
Are you the type of person who is frustrated or inspired by technical debt that you want to pay it down and find ways to avoid it building up again?
Does finding or resolving security vulnerabilities in code, systems and services bring you joy and satisfaction?

If this aligns with your passion and career goals, then I look forward to meeting you and discussing how you can grow with us.

Sincerely,

Vee Weller
