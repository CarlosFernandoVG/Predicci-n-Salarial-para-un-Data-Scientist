Do you get excited about bringing data together for new insights and improved decisions? How about contributing to making San Francisco a better place to live, work, and play? Looking to use your skills to make a positive social impact? Then come join DataSF to empower the use of data in government!
DataSF is a small, growing team working across the City and County of San Francisco. We are a national leader in open data and our vision is to empower data-driven and impactful decision making and service delivery by making it easy for city departments and the public to share and consume high quality, trustworthy data and derive actionable insights. We work to streamline data access through light, agile data infrastructure, improving data management and governance, boosting capacity to use data through training and data science, and connecting it all together empathetically and ethically for the greater good of San Franciscans.
The City is flush with data - your mission will be to connect, transform, and automate data sharing to support City departments and the people they serve. DataSF offers data/analytics engineering services to departments to ensure the timely and efficient publication of data to the City’s open data platform as well as to support data science.

Your own life experience is a critical contribution to this effort. DataSF is committed to building a team whose diversity reflects the residents we serve.

Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.
About the Role:
Our Data Engineering Software Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering data products for our clients.
You will work with petabyte-scale data challenges, large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, machine learning, and advanced visualizations – to name a few.
You will work with data processing pipelines, ML pipelines, data processing automation, data governance, data visualization, data quality, data privacy, data warehousing.

Who We Are Looking For:
You understand engineering and computer science fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are passionate about data engineering. You'll work at petabyte-scale with SQL, ETL, data modeling, and technologies similar to Spark, Scala, C#, Java, etc..
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
What We Care About:
What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.

123,Senior Product Analyst,Nuvocargo,México,Ciudad de México,3500.0,,MXN,"Nuvocargo is reinventing the $2 trillion freight forwarding industry. We are a digital-first freight forwarder using a mix of technology and exceptional service to help companies seamlessly move products across the Americas, starting with the biggest trade lane in the world: Mexico <-> USA cross-border trucking. We were ranked #2 on Fast Company's most innovative companies in 2022 and as a Y Combinator Top Company and are looking for top talent to embrace this adventure.
The opportunity for you:

Data drives Nuvocargo! We're looking for rockstar analytical talent to help us create the future of staking. As a product analyst, you'll be a key strategic partner to the product team and lead the way for key strategic initiatives. You'll shine the light on everything from key business KPIs and metrics and product usage to protocol risk and understanding.

You will not just answer questions but direct us to ask the right questions. Questions and insights that will steer us to win. You care about the customer, product usability, market share, combining business and user value to build a truly compelling product experience.

You'll collaborate with our world-class EPD team led by veterans who have held senior product and engineering positions early on at companies like Dropbox ($10B+) and Common (raised $100m+)to shape the direction of our shipper offering and internal tools in an industry where the average customer NPS is negative or very low, and where most internal processes do not rely on modern software tools to unlock revenue growth and a superior customer experience.

Who are you?
You are the data pioneer at Nuvocargo. As the first product analyst hired, you should have a robust knowledge of consumer lifecycle and behavior analysis, customer segmentation, end-to-end funnel analysis, and business operations.
You have at least 5 years of experience working as a Product analyst or data scientist. You have a track record of helping cross-functional product teams identify and prioritize analytics needs and experimentation opportunities that will deliver high-quality, data-driven insights in a timely manner using the appropriate methodologies
You have a strong technical background.
Expertise with tools used for analysis, visualization, and dashboarding, such as Looker, Amplitude, and Hex.
Experience using statistical techniques, particularly in terms of experimentation and A/B testing
You have advanced SQL Skills. Experience building aggregates and optimizing data workstreams
Experience accessing and manipulating database data using Python preferred
You move with speed. You move incredibly fast, making decisions and overcoming obstacles with speed. You can ruthlessly prioritize and make speedy decisions considering qualitative and quantitative data, user needs, business goals, and company resources.
You create structure out of ambiguity. Logistics is a complex industry with multiple stakeholders involved in every transaction. You will thrive here if you can extract structured insights and determine product priorities by merely observing and conversing with our stakeholders.
You are both a great communicator and listener. You are great at synthesizing inputs from different sources; you speak and write clearly, concisely, and with a structure that gets everyone on the same page when things feel messy.
This will NOT be a good fit for you if:
You love to ideate, but you don't love to do it. We expect you to make things happen by combining a strategic mindset with a bias towards action.
You have a fixed mindset. We have an entrepreneurial culture and look for a self-starter who can readily acknowledge mistakes, own them, fix them, and learn from them in short cycles.
You want to work with only ""tech"" folks. Modernizing an industry like logistics requires patience and empathy; you need to be excited about surprising and delighting stakeholders that come from a world outside of Silicon Valley.
What you'll do in a typical week:
Partner with Product Engineering and product managers, understand goals, craft critical metrics, and measure ongoing performance.
Inform future experimentation design and roadmaps by performing exploratory analysis to understand user engagement behavior and derive insights
Identify key trends and build executive-facing dashboards to track the progress of acquisition, monetization, and engagement trends.
Develop a deep understanding of the product; define the key metrics to guide the team in the early phases of identifying product market fit.
Own data analysis and visualization, and communicate the outcomes/insights to various stakeholders to aid strategic decisions for improvements in the international logistic process.

Nuvocargo is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
More about Nuvocargo:

International logistics is the multi-trillion dollar connective tissue of the world economy, but it's been slow to leverage the power of technology; it's finally going digital, and Nuvocargo is playing a big role in driving this historic shift.

We believe that true expertise in logistics cannot be automated and is incredibly valuable; however, we think software and technology can give logistics professionals superpowers to help provide shippers with the best service, and make everyone's lives easier.

We're growing quickly, and are backed by some of the world's best investors from both Silicon Valley and Latin America such as Tiger Global Management, The Flexport Fund, QED (founders of $60B+ Capital One), NFX (Silicon Valley fund with $10bn in exits), the founders of Nubank ($30B+), Loft ($3B+), Ramp ($2B+), and Rappi ($5B+), Y Combinator (~1% acceptance rate, created $300bn worth of startups), and angels who have built, exited, or currently sit on the board of companies worth over $100 billion.

Our DNA is comprised of four very distinct worlds and cultures: Silicon Valley, Logistics, Latin America, and USA. We are at the intersection of these worlds and laying the foundations for hyper-growth at one of the most tech-forward 3PL's in both the US and Mexico.
